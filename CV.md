### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE  
**November 2018 - present**  
**Institute for Health Informatics, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities**

1. Run analysis on physical and mental illness datasets by:
 - Cleaning and performing exploratory data analysis to verify data integrity
 - Maintaining and documenting analytical datasets
 - Building and running predictive models using supervised and unsupervised techniques 
 - Visualizing the performance metrics of the models for interpretation
 - Using Git and Github for version control and to develop best practices
 - Developing and modifying software and demonstrations. Creating documentation for all software, code, and experiments
 - Writing and helping to prepare technical reports and publications
 - Communicating and presenting analytical results to customers, scientists, and clinicians.

2. Built a web app using Flask and Dash that works with NIH datasets by:
 - scraping information to build data dictionaries
 - processing and cleaning the raw data (based on patterns in the data formatting)
 - visualizes the data via a table, histogram, bar chart, heatmap, line plot, and box and violinplots
 - merging multiple datasets efficiently column-based and row-based using raw Python
 - transforms datasets from a longitudinal format to a wide format
 - calculates descriptive statistics of the input file
 - shareable as an executable for MacOS and Windows using Github Releases

3. Developed an R package based on a colleague's code for internal use to facilitate topological data analysis among our team
 - Maintained using Git and Github


**May 2017 - September 2018**  
**National Center for Supercomputing Applications** ***(Matias Carrasco Kind)***, **Urbana, IL**  
- Created a simulation of 10000 galaxies using Python and calculated 22 statistical features  
- Applied algorithms to classify galaxies into 3 structural classes  
- Tested algorithms on MICE simulation data and identified galaxies in clusters, filaments, and voids  
- Compared predictions between two halo finders to determine which predicts better  
 
  
**University of Illinois Department of Physics, Urbana, IL** 
  
**May 2017 - present**  
***Research Assistant, Helium Reionization (Prof. Gilbert Holder)***  
- Calculated the optical depth of helium ionized bubbles and derived an equation 
- Analyzed effects of the helium bubbles by modeling the CMB angular power spectrum  
  
**August 2014 - present**  
***Research Assistant, Wireless Power Transmission (Prof. Alfred Hübler)***  
- Published one paper and filed a patent application on Wireless Energy Transfer
- Determined best parameters for optimal power using MATLAB simulations
- Conducted microwave experiments to demonstrate power flow efficiency using digital radio
