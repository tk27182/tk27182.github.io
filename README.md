I am a Junior Data Scientist/Scientific Programmer at the University of Minnesota's Institute of Health Informatics. I work for Dr. Sisi Ma and Dr. Jessica Nielson on various data science projects involving various physical and mental illness datasets. I work from the point the data has been collected, processing, exploring, visualizing, and cleaning the datasets to be run in our analytical pipelines, until the results come back and need to be evaluated and interpreted. I use various machine learning and causal inference algorithms, as well as statistical tests in these projects. As I mature in my career, I am taking a deeper interest in learning methods to optimally structure projects so that design, testing, debugging, and documenting are done efficiently and accurately.

I graduated from the University of Illinois in May 2017 with degrees in physics and astronomy, along with minors in mathematics and communications. I am interested in using data science to help improve people's lives. In my free time, I love watching baseball, playing on and managing softball teams, exploring new areas and food in the Twin Cities, hiking, cross-country skiing, gardening, cooking, and volunteering at the St. Lawrence Newman Center.
